# Demo R scripts and transcripts for videos associated with the R tutorials available here: https://rampages.us/rmodules/

# Learning objectives for each module are listed below : 

## (A) Data Management
 

### (A1) R Programming Basics
Recognize the elements of the R studio environment
Employ basic initializing commands to establish a workspace in R studio (setting a working directory, reading in data, installing and loading packages, and querying package documentation for more information about functions)
Recognize the attributes and class of common data objects
Recognize the brackets [,] operator and understand its basic functionality as a way to interact with data objects
 

### (A2) Manipulating and Recoding Data in R
Learn to apply the brackets [,] operator to manipulate and recode data
Recognize the structure of a conditional statement (ifelse) and understand the utility of vectorization
Apply merge() and write.table() to merge and export data files
 

### (A3) Strings, Pattern Matching, and For Loops
Learn to use two functions for manipulating strings: str_split_fixed() and paste()
Learn to use two functions for pattern matching and replacement: grep() and gsub()
Recognize the structure of a For Loop
 

## (B) Data Analysis
 

### (B1) Frequencies, Crosstabs, and Descriptive Statistics
Learn to use three functions for generating frequencies, crosstabs, and descriptives: table(), describe(), and count()
Become familiar with the different options for creating and exporting tables and plots in R using sjPlot, stargazer, and ggplot2
 

### (B2) Comparing Means and Frequencies
Learn to use three functions for comparing means and frequencies: t.test(), aov(), and chisq.test()
Recognize the structure of the output objects generated by t.test(), aov(), and chisq.test()
Practice generating tables to display results using sjplot and stargazer
Practice visualizing the results in R using the sjplot
 

### (B3) Linear models
Learn to use two functions for conducting linear and logistic regression models: lm() and glm()
Recognize the structure of the output objects generated by lm() and glm()
Practice generating tables to display results using sjplot and stargazer
Practice visualizing the results in R using the sjplot
 

### (B4) Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
Learn the fundamental model syntax and methods for extracting results from two R packages packages for fitting structural equation models: lavaan and OpenMx
Recognize the differences between lavaan and OpenMx with respect to ease of use and utility
Practice generating plots of structural equation models using semPlot
